          '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is going to be the only crypto post for now and an announcement:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Rule 6: Bitcoins &amp;amp; cryptocurrenies should be discussed in &lt;a href="/r/CryptoCurrency"&gt;r/CryptoCurrency&lt;/a&gt;.  Posts regarding this topic will be automatically removed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If there&amp;#39;s a stock correlated with cryptocurrencies, like coinbase going IPO, then that&amp;#39;s fine, you might have to message the mods after posting to have it approved, no big deal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also if you&amp;#39;re questioning whether something is an investment or not, just search for it on &lt;a href="/r/personalfinance"&gt;r/personalfinance&lt;/a&gt;.  For general currency trading strategies, see &lt;a href="/r/forex"&gt;r/forex&lt;/a&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re wondering if bitcoins are an investment or if there will be a crash, read on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Are cryptocurrencies an investment?&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This post is going to deal with bitcoins &amp;amp; cryptocurrencies as an &lt;em&gt;investment&lt;/em&gt;... they&amp;#39;re more &lt;a href="http://www.investopedia.com/video/play/speculation/"&gt;speculative.&lt;/a&gt;  All currencies are speculative mostly due to how the forex market works, but more because of exchange rates between countries keep currencies balanced (including inflation, country debt, interest rates, political &amp;amp; economic stability, etc), so you can only profit in price fluctuations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sure you could buy the currency of a depressed country, like Mexico decades ago, and then hold in the hopes it&amp;#39;ll go up (which it did for Mexico), but that&amp;#39;s also speculation (no one knew Mexico would pay off so much debt).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bitcoins are also affected by other countries&amp;#39; currency values, but more so by the future expectation of legitimacy, world wide adoption, limited gains from mining, and eventual limit in supply.  But at any given moment the United States could pay off more debt, raise interest rates to reduce inflation (or cause deflation), grow GDP, or even reduce the supply of USD all of which would increase the value of USD (keep in mind bitcoins can&amp;#39;t do any of these things).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Far too many people are treating cryptocoins as an investment because currently (June 5th 2017) a lot of crypto &lt;em&gt;investors&lt;/em&gt; are worth a lot of money, god bless you people, so this post will also help you determine if we&amp;#39;re headed for a crypto crash and maybe you can keep those profits.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Should I &lt;em&gt;invest&lt;/em&gt; in cryptocurrencies?&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Understand that an investment is something you hope will go up in the future or provide income, both of which for the long term vs speculation which profits on &lt;a href="http://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investment.asp"&gt;short term inefficiencies.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speculative securities&lt;/strong&gt; are typically commodities, options, bonds, and currencies, but also stocks that are volatile enough to give you extreme returns or extreme loses.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Examples of investments:&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Stocks:  A company&amp;#39;s stock is an investment because the company&amp;#39;s purpose is to continually grow and profit which is reflected in the stock price.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Real estate:  Typically you&amp;#39;re in real estate for the rental income, but there is also the opportunity that property value will go up in the future depending on the local property market.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Examples of speculation:&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Overvalued stocks: AMZN a few years ago was more speculative than an investment when P/Es were over 1000 because the stock price was so high compared to how much Amazon was earning at the time and the possibility of earning even more was speculative.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Options: An option contract worth 10 cents to buy AAPL at $200 in 2018, if AAPL goes over $200 you&amp;#39;ll make several 100s of percentage points, if not you&amp;#39;ll lose everything.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Bio pharmaceutical stocks - FDA approval can send these stocks soaring or a bad drug trial will make you lose everything&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pennystock.asp"&gt;Penny stocks&lt;/a&gt; - several factors contributing to extreme price movements up &amp;amp; down&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Gold - global turmoil can send gold to new highs&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Hoarding a ton of &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4s7V9I7LVp4"&gt;Flooz giftcards&lt;/a&gt; or Facebook credits in hopes they&amp;#39;ll go up in value, if not they&amp;#39;re worthless.  Also works on beanie babies, tickle me elmos, and collector items.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Reducing the risk of speculation&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Typically for speculation you reduce risk by reducing your trade size and timeframe, but since you&amp;#39;re trying to invest into something that is speculative, you can try:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Asset allocation&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/assetallocation.asp"&gt;a strategy that reduces risk.&lt;/a&gt;.  If you&amp;#39;re 80% stocks, 15% bonds, 4% gold, and 1% bitcoins, if something were to happen to bitcoins, you still have 99% of your money.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But even very aggressive long term portfolios &lt;strong&gt;leave speculation out completely&lt;/strong&gt; and just go 100% stocks because stocks benefit from growth while speculative securities like gold benefit from global turmoil in the short term.  Only mid risk &amp;amp; mid term portfolios can take advantage of gold&amp;#39;s speculative returns.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I also mention asset allocation because many crypto investors have been using this strategy on a portfolio of 100% crypto coins, but that doesn&amp;#39;t help you reduce the overall risk of crypto coins, you&amp;#39;re just reducing the risk of 1 speculative asset with another speculative asset.  100% crypto portfolio would face the same risks such as being made illegal, IRS aggressively hunting down crypto profits, a drop in correlated coin markets, or just a loss of popularity would all cause a sell off.  Even the USD or Chinese currencies becoming more valuable would reduce the value of crypto coins.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Should I buy coins right now?&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cryptocoins are a better &lt;em&gt;investment&lt;/em&gt; after a period of &lt;a href="http://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/consolidation.asp"&gt;consolidation&lt;/a&gt; when &lt;a href="http://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/volatility.asp"&gt;volatility&lt;/a&gt; has stabilized:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="http://i.imgur.com/AP0xS5N.png"&gt;Bitcoin 2013/2014 speculation, chart&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;High volatility, extremely overbought signals&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="http://i.imgur.com/4Susvx7.png"&gt;Bitcoin 2015 consolidation, chart&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Becoming more of an investment opportunity after volatility went down&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Source Bitstamp exchange, while the volume is #2 to GDAX, Bitstamp is better to look at for historical price/data, &lt;a href="https://bitcoincharts.com/markets/currency/USD.html"&gt;more charts here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;RSI &amp;amp; MACD key for above charts and primer&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;RSI overbought =&amp;gt; 70%, oversold =&amp;lt; 30%&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;MACD crossover is generally used for buy/sell signals and the green histogram anticipates that crossover by growing/shrinking.  Also when the lines rise or fall to extremes (which is relative) give overbought/oversold signals, so we&amp;#39;re going to use it to confirm or reject RSI.  (If you think MACD crossovers are magic, don&amp;#39;t, it&amp;#39;s always late (crossing after the point you should sell or buy), but the crossover usually signals even more buying/selling, yet MACD is best used for confirming other indicators which is why I&amp;#39;m using them in these charts)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Analyzing overbought signals&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So the first chart above have RSI &amp;amp; MACD screaming that bitcoin is overbought and you shouldn&amp;#39;t invest in 2013/2014.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The black squares in the 2nd chart show consolidation and reduced volatility, a &amp;quot;better&amp;quot; time to invest.  If you were trading short term, it would be a whole different story, and there would be opportunities to buy &amp;amp; short, but since this is written for investing, the small overbought signals are ignored, so if you were to buy Bitcoin at $300 inside the first blacksquare (2nd chart) and then it suddenly drops to 25%, it&amp;#39;s okay because the volatility is much lower compared to previous price movements (nothing compared to 80% loss in the 1st chart).  Any investor would tell you a 25% drop is terrible, but bitcoins are speculative and that kind of drop is pretty damn good for this level of volatility.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Nothing goes straight up forever&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;and anything that comes near this vertical incline will eventually lose 80% to near 100%, always happens, it&amp;#39;s usually preceded by &lt;strong&gt;emotions (price euphoria), attention, and increased volume&lt;/strong&gt;, all classic &lt;a href="http://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/020216/4-things-make-stock-risky-bet.asp"&gt;signs that something is becoming riskier.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Other speculative securities gaining multiples and then losing 80% to near 100% of value:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://i.imgur.com/UQNYds7.png"&gt;Gold&lt;/a&gt; - detailed, shows two big corrections *happened multiple times in gold&amp;#39;s long history&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://i.imgur.com/1bNGOYL.png"&gt;AMD&lt;/a&gt; - 475% gains, then slide down to 84% loss  *this has happened several times to AMD (1983, 1997, 2001, 2006)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://i.imgur.com/ATBmtD9.png"&gt;MJNA&lt;/a&gt; - these patterns in penny stocks are easier to see, they&amp;#39;re the epitome of speculation&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://i.imgur.com/0Brkbj6.png"&gt;Crude oil&lt;/a&gt; - I only took the 2006 to 2010 period which saw 3x increase and then a 76% loss, but oil was actually in a 7.5x incline since 2002&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://i.imgur.com/lBmd51s.png"&gt;AAPL&lt;/a&gt; - YES APPLE NO EXCEPTIONS, however with stocks it&amp;#39;s easier to justify price increases because of earnings growth, but in this case AAPL was very overbought and earnings couldn&amp;#39;t grow fast enough (even though earnings was already extreme).  After a few mini corrections, a big one came which was 50% loss from the top.  Keep in mind when looking at this chart that the previous price before the 7-1 stock split was $705 making the top $100.71 (I wrote it on the chart).  Here the missing signal is increased volume, but we have another signal being MACD divergence which came late, but could have saved you another 20ish % loss.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Notable comments on reddit:&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;*This is just to get you guys looking at different subs on this topic, and yeah it&amp;#39;s mostly anti-crypto, but don&amp;#39;t let that discourage you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/6as4wn/as_a_genuine_cryptoenthusiast_i_was_fairly/dhgyw0r/"&gt;&amp;quot;Everyone was so wrapped up in which beanie baby would be worth the most in 20 years but nobody stopped to ask if anyone would care about beanie babies in 20 years. &amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/6copmu/cryptocurrency_questions/dhw77fb/"&gt;&amp;quot;All cryptocurrency is speculation... most of the new cryptocurrency that&amp;#39;s popping up are all cash grabs.

MACD levels are the same as 2013&amp;#39;s crash, but the increased in value is around 4.3x or 2.4x (depending on which you look at), so maybe we&amp;#39;ll see another spike before a crash, I don&amp;#39;t know, it&amp;#39;s up to interpretation right now.  There&amp;#39;s the &lt;a href="http://www.investopedia.com/articles/technical/02/061802.asp"&gt;emotional price levels&lt;/a&gt; of 3000 and 4000 that we might have no problem getting to in an overbought environment before a correction.  And how big will the correction be?  I think 80%, but it very well could be around 50% down to $1200, the previous level of resistance which would become support.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I put everything above in its own wiki &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/are-cryptocurrencies-investments"&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well I hope that helps everyone.

          'This is going to be the only crypto post for now and an announcement:\n\nRule 6: Bitcoins &amp; cryptocurrenies should be discussed in r/CryptoCurrency.  Posts regarding this topic will be automatically removed.\n\nIf there\'s a stock correlated with cryptocurrencies, like coinbase going IPO, then that\'s fine, you might have to message the mods after posting to have it approved, no big deal.\n\nAlso if you\'re questioning whether something is an investment or not, just search for it on r/personalfinance.  For general currency trading strategies, see r/forex .\n\nIf you\'re wondering if bitcoins are an investment or if there will be a crash, read on.\n\n------\n\n##Are cryptocurrencies an investment?\n\nThis post is going to deal with bitcoins &amp; cryptocurrencies as an *investment*... they\'re more [speculative.](http://www.investopedia.com/video/play/speculation/)  All currencies are speculative mostly due to how the forex market works, but more because of exchange rates between countries keep currencies balanced (including inflation, country debt, interest rates, political &amp; economic stability, etc), so you can only profit in price fluctuations.\n\nSure you could buy the currency of a depressed country, like Mexico decades ago, and then hold in the hopes it\'ll go up (which it did for Mexico), but that\'s also speculation (no one knew Mexico would pay off so much debt).\n\nBitcoins are also affected by other countries\' currency values, but more so by the future expectation of legitimacy, world wide adoption, limited gains from mining, and eventual limit in supply.  But at any given moment the United States could pay off more debt, raise interest rates to reduce inflation (or cause deflation), grow GDP, or even reduce the supply of USD all of which would increase the value of USD (keep in mind bitcoins can\'t do any of these things).\n\nFar too many people are treating cryptocoins as an investment because currently (June 5th 2017) a lot of crypto *investors* are worth a lot of money, god bless you people, so this post will also help you determine if we\'re headed for a crypto crash and maybe you can keep those profits.\n\n##Should I *invest* in cryptocurrencies?\n\nUnderstand that an investment is something you hope will go up in the future or provide income, both of which for the long term vs speculation which profits on [short term inefficiencies.](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investment.asp)\n\n**Speculative securities** are typically commodities, options, bonds, and currencies, but also stocks that are volatile enough to give you extreme returns or extreme loses.\n\n###Examples of investments:\n\n* Stocks:  A company\'s stock is an investment because the company\'s purpose is to continually grow and profit which is reflected in the stock price.\n* Real estate:  Typically you\'re in real estate for the rental income, but there is also the opportunity that property value will go up in the future depending on the local property market.\n\n###Examples of speculation:\n\n* Overvalued stocks: AMZN a few years ago was more speculative than an investment when P/Es were over 1000 because the stock price was so high compared to how much Amazon was earning at the time and the possibility of earning even more was speculative.\n* Options: An option contract worth 10 cents to buy AAPL at $200 in 2018, if AAPL goes over $200 you\'ll make several 100s of percentage points, if not you\'ll lose everything.\n* Bio pharmaceutical stocks - FDA approval can send these stocks soaring or a bad drug trial will make you lose everything\n* [Penny stocks](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pennystock.asp) - several factors contributing to extreme price movements up &amp; down\n* Gold - global turmoil can send gold to new highs\n* Hoarding a ton of [Flooz giftcards](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4s7V9I7LVp4) or Facebook credits in hopes they\'ll go up in value, if not they\'re worthless.  Also works on beanie babies, tickle me elmos, and collector items.\n\n##Reducing the risk of speculation\n\nTypically for speculation you reduce risk by reducing your trade size and timeframe, but since you\'re trying to invest into something that is speculative, you can try:\n\n**Asset allocation**, [a strategy that reduces risk.](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/assetallocation.asp).  If you\'re 80% stocks, 15% bonds, 4% gold, and 1% bitcoins, if something were to happen to bitcoins, you still have 99% of your money.\n\nBut even very aggressive long term portfolios **leave speculation out completely** and just go 100% stocks because stocks benefit from growth while speculative securities like gold benefit from global turmoil in the short term.  Only mid risk &amp; mid term portfolios can take advantage of gold\'s speculative returns.\n\nI also mention asset allocation because many crypto investors have been using this strategy on a portfolio of 100% crypto coins, but that doesn\'t help you reduce the overall risk of crypto coins, you\'re just reducing the risk of 1 speculative asset with another speculative asset.  100% crypto portfolio would face the same risks such as being made illegal, IRS aggressively hunting down crypto profits, a drop in correlated coin markets, or just a loss of popularity would all cause a sell off.  Even the USD or Chinese currencies becoming more valuable would reduce the value of crypto coins.\n\n##Should I buy coins right now?\n\nCryptocoins are a better *investment* after a period of [consolidation](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/consolidation.asp) when [volatility](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/volatility.asp) has stabilized:\n\n###[Bitcoin 2013/2014 speculation, chart](http://i.imgur.com/AP0xS5N.png)\n\n* High volatility, extremely overbought signals\n\n###[Bitcoin 2015 consolidation, chart](http://i.imgur.com/4Susvx7.png)\n\n* Becoming more of an investment opportunity after volatility went down\n\nSource Bitstamp exchange, while the volume is #2 to GDAX, Bitstamp is better to look at for historical price/data, [more charts here.](https://bitcoincharts.com/markets/currency/USD.html)\n\n###RSI &amp; MACD key for above charts and primer\n\n* RSI overbought =&gt; 70%, oversold =&lt; 30%\n* MACD crossover is generally used for buy/sell signals and the green histogram anticipates that crossover by growing/shrinking.  Also when the lines rise or fall to extremes (which is relative) give overbought/oversold signals, so we\'re going to use it to confirm or reject RSI.  (If you think MACD crossovers are magic, don\'t, it\'s always late (crossing after the point you should sell or buy), but the crossover usually signals even more buying/selling, yet MACD is best used for confirming other indicators which is why I\'m using them in these charts)\n\n###Analyzing overbought signals\n\nSo the first chart above have RSI &amp; MACD screaming that bitcoin is overbought and you shouldn\'t invest in 2013/2014.\n\nThe black squares in the 2nd chart show consolidation and reduced volatility, a "better" time to invest.  If you were trading short term, it would be a whole different story, and there would be opportunities to buy &amp; short, but since this is written for investing, the small overbought signals are ignored, so if you were to buy Bitcoin at $300 inside the first blacksquare (2nd chart) and then it suddenly drops to 25%, it\'s okay because the volatility is much lower compared to previous price movements (nothing compared to 80% loss in the 1st chart).  Any investor would tell you a 25% drop is terrible, but bitcoins are speculative and that kind of drop is pretty damn good for this level of volatility.\n\n##Nothing goes straight up forever\n\nand anything that comes near this vertical incline will eventually lose 80% to near 100%, always happens, it\'s usually preceded by **emotions (price euphoria), attention, and increased volume**, all classic [signs that something is becoming riskier.](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/020216/4-things-make-stock-risky-bet.asp)\n\nOther speculative securities gaining multiples and then losing 80% to near 100% of value:\n\n* [Gold](http://i.imgur.com/UQNYds7.png) - detailed, shows two big corrections *happened multiple times in gold\'s long history\n* [AMD](http://i.imgur.com/1bNGOYL.png) - 475% gains, then slide down to 84% loss  *this has happened several times to AMD (1983, 1997, 2001, 2006)\n* [MJNA](http://i.imgur.com/ATBmtD9.png) - these patterns in penny stocks are easier to see, they\'re the epitome of speculation\n* [Crude oil](http://i.imgur.com/0Brkbj6.png) - I only took the 2006 to 2010 period which saw 3x increase and then a 76% loss, but oil was actually in a 7.5x incline since 2002\n* [AAPL](http://i.imgur.com/lBmd51s.png) - YES APPLE NO EXCEPTIONS, however with stocks it\'s easier to justify price increases because of earnings growth, but in this case AAPL was very overbought and earnings couldn\'t grow fast enough (even though earnings was already extreme).  After a few mini corrections, a big one came which was 50% loss from the top.  Keep in mind when looking at this chart that the previous price before the 7-1 stock split was $705 making the top $100.71 (I wrote it on the chart).  Here the missing signal is increased volume, but we have another signal being MACD divergence which came late, but could have saved you another 20ish % loss.\n\n##Notable comments on reddit:\n\n*This is just to get you guys looking at different subs on this topic, and yeah it\'s mostly anti-crypto, but don\'t let that discourage you.\n\n* ["Everyone was so wrapped up in which beanie baby would be worth the most in 20 years but nobody stopped to ask if anyone would care about beanie babies in 20 years.
